# Fraud-Detection-in-Insurance-Systems-using-Machine-Learning

A secure and automated insurance system framework was presented that reduces human interaction, secures insurance activities, detects fraudulent claims, and reduces monetary loss. Cryptography-based application(RSA) was used to secure data sharing among different interacting agents within the insurance network, and the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm was employed for the insurance services.

Highlights: 

⁃ The insurance data is cleaned and feature-engineered to optimise machine learning algorithm performance. Performed Tests to show that the XGBoost algorithm significantly outperforms algorithms like decision tree, logistic regression, SVC, KNN, and random forest. 

⁃ Data Analysis & Data Validation was done to get a complete bird's eye view. Data were split into training and testing data and balanced using SMOTE. Evaluated the models using the F1 score and ROC AUC score as model selection criteria.

⁃ The cryptography module utilized the RSA algorithm. Insurance claims were encrypted, generating a private key in the process, before being transmitted to the certified fraud detection institution. The institution then decrypted the insurance claims data using the provided private key in order to analyze the contents. This encryption-decryption process protected the sensitive information while allowing analysis by authorized parties.

⁃ A simple yet eye-catching interface was developed to feed the input for checking.
