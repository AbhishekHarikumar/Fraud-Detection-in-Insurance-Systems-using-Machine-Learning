# Fraud Detection Model in Insurance Systems using Machine Learning

<h2 align="left">Executive Summary</h2>

<p align="justify"> Fraud Detection Model that utilizes machine learning to predict whether a claim is fraudulent or legitimate based on the given input. The model is deployed using Flask, along with a user-friendly UI interface that provides access to this functionality. It is trained using Extreme Gradient Boosting Trees, leveraging a wide range of randomly drawn data. The model is generalized with an accuracy of 83% and achieves a perfect balance between precision and recall for optimal performance. The RSA Cryptography Algorithm is implemented to ensure secure access to the model and prevent unauthorized usage. </p>

<h2 align = "left">Objective</h2>

<p align="justify"> To build a model that accurately classifies whether a prediction is fraudulent or not, ensuring authorized access.</p>

<h2 align="left">Process Workflow</h2>

- <p align="justify"> Conduct Indepth Research of the datasets available in the internet, with the goal of finding the one which is diverse and huge in categories and number which simulates, real world scenarios. The Insurance Fraud Detection Dataset on kaggle satisfies the following conditions.</p>

- Perform Analysis on the data extracted from Kaggle, to get an understanding of the data's metrics as follows:
  - Missing Values(1000 records) 
  - Categorical Types(21 Columns)
  - Continous Types (18 Columns)
  - Skewness
  - Outliers
  - Imbalance (No 75% :Yes 24%)
    
<h2 align="left">Business Value</h2>

- <p align="justify"> Increased fraud security prevention by 20% by developing a secure insurance framework with RSA cryptography and  a  fraud detection model using Extreme Gradient Boosting Trees with an accuracy of 83%.</p>

- <p align="justify"> Developed and put into use a thorough fraud detection system user interface (UI) utilising Flask to provide  effective UI interaction to lower financial crime.</p>

- <p align="justify"> Published in the International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews(A+ Grade) contibuting to the community. </p>
