- Increased fraud security prevention by 20% by developing a secure insurance framework with RSA cryptography and XG Boosting Trees with an accuracy of 83%.

- Performed EDA and researched to gather findings necessary for the model building.

- Compared multiple machine learning models to decide which makes the best fit.

- Developed and put into use a thorough fraud detection system user interface (UI) utilising Flask and Python to provide rapid and effective UI interaction to lower financial crime.

- Published in the International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews(A+ Grade).
